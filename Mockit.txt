Viewing the dashboard, server and api
Once Docker is running you have three applications running on the machine.

The client: http://localhost:5000
The client server: http://localhost:4000
The MockIt API (this is the server that runs your API): http://localhost:3000
If you want to view the dashboard to get started go to http://localhost:5000.

If you want to interact with your new API go to http://localhost:3000.

For example if you have a /user route setup, go to http://localhost:3000/user to view the data.
